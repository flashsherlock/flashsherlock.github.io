For example, AFNI uses RAI system (-x = Right, -y = Anterior, -z = Inferior) by default while SPM uses LPI system. However, this could not explain why the same image may look different in AFNI and SPM (or MRIcron). Obliquity is probably the real reason.</description></item><item><title>3D-print your brain</title><link>https://flashsherlock.github.io/2021/10/23/how-to-print-your-brain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flashsherlock.github.io/2021/10/23/how-to-print-your-brain/</guid><description>1 My little brain 2 Print your brain step-by-step 2.1 Scan your brain 2.2 Reconstruct brain surfaces 2.3 Convert and edit the surfaces 2.4 Refine the brain model and print it 3 Other related tutorials 1 My little brain In this National Day holiday, I made a 3D model of my brain and found a company on Taobao to 3D-print it. The finished product is about 10cm × 9cm × 6.</description></item><item><title>iEEG: Localization of intracranial electrodes</title><link>https://flashsherlock.github.io/2021/01/12/ieeg-localization-of-intracranial-electrodes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flashsherlock.github.io/2021/01/12/ieeg-localization-of-intracranial-electrodes/</guid><description>1 Introduction 2 Overview 3 Preprocessing of MRI image 4 Preprocessing of CT image 5 Fusion of the CT with the MRI 6 Electrodes placement 7 Volume-based registration 8 Anatomical labeling 1 Introduction This is a simple tutorial for electrodes localization. For more information and examples, please refer to Fieldtrip tutorials. Matlab, SPM, and Fieldtrip are required for this procedure. After adding the directory of Fieldtrip toolbox to searching path, you need to initialize it by running the command ft_defaults as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
