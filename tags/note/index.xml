Luck proposed ten rules for ERP experiments.
Peaks and components are not the same thing. There is nothing special about the point at which the voltage reaches a local maximum or minimum.
It is impossible to estimate the time course or peak latency of a latent ERP component by looking at a single ERP waveform â€“ there may be no obvious relationship between the shape of a local part of the waveform and the underlying latent components.</description></item></channel></rss>
